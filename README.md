## Course Description

Abstract: Computer-generated images are everywhere in movies, video games, and VR. This course is an introduction to the techniques to animate objects in computer graphics based on the law of physics. The aim of the course is to get familiar with applied mathematics such as linear algebra, vector analysis, partial differential equations, variational principle, optimization, and numerical analysis through the animation techniques for particle systems, rigid bodies, elastic bodies. There are C++ programming assignments to acquire research-oriented graphics programming skills. 

Topics:
- mass-spring simulation
- rigid body simulation
- elastic body simulation
- cloth and hair modeling & simulation
- collision-detection using spatial hashing
- finite boundary method
